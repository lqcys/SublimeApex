```javascript
{
    // In OSX, the worspace path is different with windows,

    "workspace": "d:/ForcedotcomWorkspace",
    "projects": {
        "Project1 Name": {

## Key Bindings - Default
Here are the all key bindings to corresponding command, you can customize them according to your habit.

        "press_command": "goto_component", 
        "press_args": {"is_background": true}
    },

    // Press Shift and Click Left Mouse for triple will open class file
    {
        "button": "button1", "count": 3, "modifiers": ["shift"],
        "press_command": "goto_component",

+ [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict)

# Notes: #
1. Every time when we refresh all apex code from server, the sobject field completions will be initiated at the same time.

2. When we want to execute anonymous or query, we must choose any valid snippet in sublime and click the command.

3. Actually, retrieve all just retrieve sobject and workflow metadata, because this process is largely time-consuming.

4. Before we want to export validation rule or workflow, we must retrieve all, because we export the validation rule and workflow by parsing the metadata file.

5. Every time we save the apex code, your local copy will be put into project/history path every minute.

6. If we have two classes, the first one of which is the utility class for the second one, it would be best to open the first class so that we can see the variable completions when we edit the first one.

7. When we want to run test, basically, your test result should be displayed as a new view.

8. If we want to refresh the folder, we just need to click the SublimeApex > Refresh Folder and then choose the folder we want to refresh.

9. Before we update plugin, we should move your customized settings from "Settings - Default" to "Settings - User"

10. Every time when you create a new view, it's default syntax is Apex.

11. If you don't want to keep the local history change, you can set keep_local_change_history to false in the settings.

12. If you want to output the session info, you can set output_session_info to true in the settings.
